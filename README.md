# Data-Mining-Project

ABSTRACT: Data Mining is a process commonly used to analyze data and generate models with predictive power based on that data. There is a litany of Data Mining software and tools to help us with calculations related to a large dataset, and the software we utilized in this project was WEKA, a data mining program originating from New Zealand. To provide an entertaining and practical application to Data Mining, we decided to focus on data relating to NBA All-Stars. The NBA All-Star draft is an annual event where the top players of each conference are voted on by fans to represent their entire conference in the annual NBA All-Star game.  Our goal is to use and explain different data mining techniques to give a statistical definition to a player’s “popularity” relating to the NBA All-Star Draft. In other words, to prove that the NBA All-Star Draft is a bit more predictable than one might think. 

We used data relating to the top 20 PPG scorers from the past 10 NBA seasons to make our predictions, using identifiers such as their position, popularity in jersey sales, and whether they were a previous All-Star or not to help predict our outcome. We used data mining techniques such as ZeroR, OneR, Naive Bayes and J48 decision trees to test the predictability of our desired outcome. In the end, using a post-pruned J48 decision tree, we were able to predict with around 90% accuracy whether any given player in the NBA would be an All-Star that year or not.
